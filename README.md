#Slice of Heaven Website
	
###Our team created a website for Slice of Heaven, a pizza eatery. The website 
allows customers who visit access to contact information with visual plugins 
to google maps, the menu and current deals, along with a plugin to Facebook. 
The administrator of Slice of Heaven has his own log in page. Once logged in 
administrator(s) will have the capability to change text regarding the menu 
(menu item name, description, price), the contact information 
(name, address, phone number), and the information on the “About Me” page.
